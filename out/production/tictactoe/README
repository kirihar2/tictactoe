Restful API design ideas

I would first use a combination of spring framework and swagger for documentation to implement Restful.

API would allow for several GET requests such as:
    - get player
    - get board to print the board
    - get score if you want to keep track of scores of how many times each player won
 API would allow for the following POST requests such as:
    - set player if the user would like to change the character the user wants to use and update the board
    - set board to start/restart at a specific point in the game. Would need to refactor the game class to hold states of the board
    - set size of the board where one is able to create a game board larger than 3 squares. Would need to refactor the board class
        to accept parameters in the constructor. The request will set the board size class variable in the Game class and will construct
        a board with that size.

These will be exposed through getter and setters for the class variables in the Game class.
